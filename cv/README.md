# Experience

// Start with two slashes for subheading

## Job Title @ Company {10/2015—Present}

Detailed description of this period of experience.

:: Add comment by starting with two colons. This is useful if you want to reference a URL on Internet.

```

## Customizing

Put your content in the `#source-md` element of `resume.html`.

You can remove the download link if you'd like.

Don't forget to change the webpage title.

If you don't want to add an avatar, simply remove `<img class="avatar" data-async-src="./avatar.png">` in the `#cont` element of `resume.html`.

## Themes

Current codebase is a scrap. You may want to create custom themes later upon the codebase gets refactored.

## For Print

This resume tool is print-ready. You can produce a PDF from the webpage. This functionality is provided in browser's printing feature.
